        <strong style="font-size: large;">Week 0 and Week 1 Updates</strong>
        <br><small>May 4th-15th</small>
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to conflicts with other events, I was not able to give many updates on both the game and dev logs in week 0.
        Since I did not add much to the game, this first journal post will combine progresses made in both weeks.
    </p>
    <small class="foot">Date of update: May 12, 2020</small>
    <p>
        <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Program Structures and Classes</i></strong>
        <br>
        In week 0, I focused on establishing a basic structure for this project. I wished
        to utilize OOP in this project (also because OOP is required for this project).
        Therefore, I created a few classes for objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, there is Object. Object is a general class for all objects in this game.
        Because probably most elements in this game will be classified as an object,
        Object class will the parent class for most classes that will be created in future.
        Some fundamental methods are defined in Object class for other classes, such as
        .setDimension() and .setPosition().
        <br>
        Secondly, there is MovableObject class that inherits Object class. Based on
        some methods provided by Object, MovableObjects provides a set of methods for
        moving objects. This class will be a parent class of Player class, mob classes
        and potentially more other classes.
        <br>
        For now, Player class only has a few "its own" methods and properties.
        In future, many systems, inventory system for example, will be associated with Player class.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Collision Detection</i></strong>
        <br>
        Since this is a 2D game that the player and mobs need to move mostly on ground,
        the program has to detect whether the mob is standing on a surface by checking
        whether the player's hit box is touching the surface. To make it easier to distinguish different kinds of
        collisions,
        both <strong>having overlaps</strong> and <strong>sharing a common boundary</strong> are considered a collision
        by a collision
        checking method, checkCollision().
        This could help avoid problem where the player cannot jump or fall, when standing on a surface, when lying
        against a wall,
        or when hitting an object that blocks its top.
        <br><br>In order to detect collisions from different directions,
        four new variables are created to indicate collision states. In checkCollision() method, it no longer returns
        a boolean value that represents whether collision has happened. Instead, it changes the collision state
        variables,
        and returns corresponding information, that is the x or y value of the colliding surface, of any existing
        collision.
        (See explanations in <strong><i>Position Re-adjustment</i></strong>)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Position Re-adjustment</i></strong>
        <br>
        After implementing a collision mechanism,
        one of the problems that pops up is a moving object might pass the hit box of the colliding object
        even after a collision is detected by the program. To solve this problem, re-adjusting the moving object
        to where the collision exactly happened is necessary.
        <br><br>
        For example, in the image shown below,
        the white block, representing a mob/player, is given the command to jump. The green block, representing a
        platform,
        should prevent the player from moving any further up after their hit boxes collide.
        But in this case, 1 game loop iteration before this, the player was not having any contact with the platform;
        because of
        its fast speed of jumping, the player block exceeds the boundary of the platform in the next game iteration.
    </p>
    <img src="/src/images/WhyReadjustPosition.png">
    <p>
        To implement the re-adjustments, checkCollision() method is changed that now it returns the information about
        the surface where
        a collision has happened, if there is a collision happened. This information will be used as new coordinates
        for the object. In addition, when an object is moving towards one direction, a boolean variable will be
        set to True to make sure there will be a position re-adjustment in this direction once the object stops moving;
        and, this variable will
        be reset to False after a re-adjustment is done. In practice, 4 such variables are needed on each direction to
        ensure that no object can
        glitch through a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this method is not perfect. In a worse case where the speed of a
        object is incredibly high (more than 1x its own width or height) or the dimensions of
        at least one colliding rectangle are too small, checkCollision() may
        not even be able to catch a colliding event. This disadvantage could be critical
        in the future for bullet flying. But maybe an alternative approach can be designed
        for high speed and small size objects, like <strong>trajectory prediction</strong>.

    <p class="weeklyTitle">
        <strong style="font-size: large;">Week 2 Updates</strong>
        <br><small>May 16-22th</small>
    </p>
    <p> In week 2, my focus was on adding more methods for player and mob class.
        I added properties for MovableObject, now moving objects can be granted flying
        ability or can be configured to be influenced by gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Fixes</i></strong>
        <br>After writing a test program, I noticed that Python uses reference
        variable to refer an object instance. So I changed spritearrdic, a dictionary
        of arrays of all sprites, to objarrdic, a dictionary of arrays of reference to
        all object instances.
    </p>
    <p>For high speed object, now checkCollision() is overridden in a MovableObject's
        child class, HighSpeedObject(). A back tracking algorithm is used to detect
        potential collisions after the object leaks to the next location. Via comparing
        the ratio of speed (change in y vs change in x) and the ratio of size (height vs width),
        another way of tracking collisions along the trajectory is made (shown in the images below).
    </p>
    <img src="/src/images/Screenshot_20200522-082757.jpg">
    <P>To simplify the complexity, overlapped rectangles need not to be checked.</P>

            <br>blue line represents the ratio of size.</small>
        <br>
        If speed ratio is greater than the size ratio, it means there will be
        conjunction on a horizontal surface, otherwise on a vertical surface.
        As long as such a "string" of high speed rectangles is checked for collision detections,
        the piercing glitches will stop popping up (hopefully).
    </p>

    <P><strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Shooting</i></strong>
        <br>Shooting bullets is one of the places where a back tracking of high speed
        object will be needed due to a bullet's small size and greater velocity.
        There will be three fire modes for a gunslinger, they are the high damage and
        high accuracy single shot mode, the high short range damage shotgun mode, and
        a grenade cannon mode. Modes can be changed by pressing number key 1, 2 and 3.
        The single shot mode is online, shotgun mode has A LOT of bugs, and grenade cannon mode
        will be added shortly.
    </P>
    <p> Fire mode 1 development:
        <br>I did some math here to determine the movement of a bullet...</p>
    <img src="/src/images/20200522_090337.jpg" style="width: 50%;">
    <img src="/src/images/Screenshot_20200522-090310_Samsung Notes.jpg" style="width: 50%;float:right">
    <p>A bullet essentially will inherit all member methods from Object, MovableObject, and HighSpeedObject.
        Updating position method is the same as the one from MovableObject class, but its
        checkCollision() method is the new overridden method defined in HighSpeedObject class.

        <strong style="font-size: large;">Week 3 Updates</strong>
        <br><small>May 24-29th</small>
    </p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Gravity</i></strong>
    <br>I left off this part from previous updates because I thought it might get changed a lot
    while I was trying to add more new objects into the game.
    </p>
    <p>In week 1, I wrote a simple gravity system by using some physics formulas. I fixed the value of 
       g (gravitational acceleration) for the visual to be more natural. I only implemented the gravity
       to objects that cannot fly.
    </p>
    <p>And in week 2, I also let flying objects have the influence of gravity. But there was an option
       to disable gravity for high speed objects like bullets. As long as at least one of gravity and
       flying ability is enabled, an object will not have any strange behavior. In another word, if both gravity
       and flying ability are disabled, the object will not have any way to move down, and that will be a disaster.
    </p>
    <p>In week 3, many new classes are created using the gravity behavior from the general MovableObject class.
       For examples, a bullet will be hover-enabled and not influenced by gravtiy; arrows and grenades will
       be more significantly influenced by gravtiy so they are not hover-enabled. I.e. Arrows will have a movement behavior that is
       more similar to an object that jumps.
    </p>
    <p><strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Professions </i></strong>
    <br>At this stage, I think I am pretty determined to make only <del>3</del> 2 professions in this game. Every profession has unique weapons 
    and unique abilities. <del>And, I am very passionate about adding flexibilities to every one of them via a special cast feature(see Cast Gesture System
    below for more info).</del> Here are some brief introductions:
    </p>
    <del>
        First, there will be a gunslinger. The gunslinger will have a knife for melee attack, and 3 ranged 
        weapons for medium/long distance attacks. Since the game has a background similar to the Age of 
        Discovery, she will have a rifle that does not have insane attack speed, a shotgun, and a grenade launcher.
        The gunslinger will feature mobility and high ranged damage.
    </del>
    <p>Second, there will be a <del>warrior</del> archer. The <del>warrior</del> archer will have a sword (probably a katana) as the melee weapon. She will have
       a bow with various arrows as the second weapon. This profession will feature
       melee attack damage and short/medium distance <del>combo</del> damage. </p>

    <p>The third is a mage. The mage does not have a melee weapon, but has powerful magic spells. The mage 
        The mage features high mobility <del>and high combo damage</del> if abilities are well used.
    </p>

    <p>Three separated classes are created for those three professions. They all 
        inherit from GeneralPlayer class which used to be called Player class. Each attack
        style is made a class so that many objects can be created based on it. 
        There are essentially two types of attacks, one is creating a projectile, the other
        is to summon a rectangle in either short distance for melee attack or long distance, for example, for
        magic spells.
    </p>
    <p>Classes are ready to go, I'll just need to bite my fingers and try to decide whether I should find arts online or make my own. And then, there probably will be
        more debugging coming soon.
    </p>

    <p><strong style="font-size: large;" class="unfinished"><i>Cast Gesture System (cut)</i></strong>
    <br><del>This is most important part of this game because of it adds so much more flexibilities to the gameplay. But to be honest,
    implementing this system is giving me a big headache. </del>
    </p>
    <del>
    <p>Cast Gesture System is a mechanism that allows a player to cast different abilities by making different gestures using mouse. 
       I came up with the idea of this controlling system when I first time attemped to make a game using GameMaker Studio a few years ago, which 
       apparently I did not succeeed. 
    </p>
    <p>An explanation of this system will be: if the player pressed the casting key Q, then the program will keep track of the movement of mouse cursor when M1 is also pressed.
       Afterward, an algorithm will be used to determine what gestures the player has made. For instance, if the player does not hold M1 when moving the cursor and clicks another location
       on the screen, a mage will teleport to that location. For another example, if the player holds M1 and moves the cursor forwards, a mage will cast an ability to attack enemy in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
       The simplest way of doing this in the simplest situation, where 
       gestures are broken down to one stroke purposely by the player, is to perform linear regression on each stroke to find out the slope. For example, if slope approaches 0,
       it indicates the stroke is horizontal. However, this method does not work really well if gestures get too complicated because it cannot even correctly recognize which direction
       the stroke goes.
    </p>

            <strong style="font-size: large;">Week 4 Updates</strong>
            <br><small>May 30th - June 5th</small>
        </p>
        <p>I have spent a lot of time on development this week, but unfortunately,
            and pretty obviously, spending too much time on one over-expected system 
            is not a very effective plan. Although I have made great progresses on the algorithms after
            I gave a dozen of hours to developing Cast Gesture System, I realized two
            challenges in applying this system to the game. First, this way of controlling
            and casting in a 2D sidescroller game, actually probably any type of game, is 
            very odd and difficult to get used to. Second, the flexibility, if it ever works,
            also brings plenty of art works. I think at this stage, after I have been stuck on this mechanism for
            weeks, I should re-consider my priority to finish the game, which is to start working
            on the visuals and UIs.
        </p>
        <p>Also, I figured that it is the same to having too many professions. I decided to 
            cut gunslinger from this project; I'll focus on at least completing one profession, that is archer;
            and, I will add features to the Mage once everything else is done.
        </p>

        <p><strong style="font-size:large;"><i>Animation:</i></strong>
        <br>I found this nicely designed sprite package that fit my game: <a href="https://oco.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-character-pack-4">Medieval Fantasy Character Pack</a> ---<a href="https://oco.itch.io/">by OcO</a>.
        But for this package, the images were combined together into one file. So I did a lot of PhotoShopings, and eventually
        I separated every frame out. Specifically to this package, I created functions that could crop empty background surrounding the actually sprite.
        In addition, I made a function that could load an animation and a function that could scale up the animation sequence, which I believed will be re-used in future.
        </p>

        <p>In terms of data structures for static images and animated images, single object references will be used for single images and 
           a list of image objects will be used for an animation sequence.
        </p>
        
        <p>To properly display animation in the correct orders, tick variables are added to main and Player class.
           For example, when jumping, a "jumping tick" variable will be recording how long the jumping event has happened.
           According to the value of the tick that reflects the state of jumping, pre-jumping images and in-air jumping images will be blitted respectively.
           This technics is also used for falling, landing, running, etc.
        </p>

        <p><strong style="font-size:large;"><i>Legacies from Cast Gesture System:</i></strong>
        <br>If you press q, and use mouse to click a location in the window, the character will be teleported to that location. This feature
        has a high likelihood to come back with implementations in future for character dodges.
        </p>
        <p>The Gesture Detection was one of the algorithms that I successfully made. It tracks gestures made by a 
            user, then tells the directions of the gestures via performing linear regression. This algorithm still
            has a hope to come back for the gameplay of the Mage.
