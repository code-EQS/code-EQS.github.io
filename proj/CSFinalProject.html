            Due to conflicts with other events, I was not able to give many updates on both the game and dev logs in week 0. 
            Since I did not add much to the game, this first journal post will combine progresses made in both weeks.

            <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Program Structures and Classes</i></strong>
            <br>
            In week 0, I focused on establishing a basic structure for this project. I wished 
            to utilize OOP in this project (also because OOP is required for this project). 
            Therefore, I created a few classes for objects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, there is Object. Object is a general class for all objects in this game.
            Because probably most elements in this game will be classified as an object, 
            Object class will the parent class for most classes that will be created in future.
            Some fundamental methods are defined in Object class for other classes, such as 
            .setDimension() and .setPosition().
            <br>
            Secondly, there is MovableObject class that inherits Object class. Based on
            some methods provided by Object, MovableObjects provides a set of methods for 
            moving objects. This class will be a parent class of Player class, mob classes
            and potentially more other classes.
            <br>
            For now, Player class only has a few "its own" methods and properties.
            In future, many systems, inventory system for example, will be associated with Player class.
        </p>

            <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Collision Detection</i></strong>
            <br>
            Since this is a 2D game that the player and mobs need to move mostly on ground, 
            the program has to detect whether the mob is standing on a surface by checking 
            whether the player's hit box is touching the surface. To make it easier to distinguish different kinds of collisions,
            both <strong>having overlaps</strong> and <strong>sharing a common boundary</strong> are considered a collision by a collision
            checking method, checkCollision().
            This could help avoid problem where the player cannot jump or fall, when standing on a surface, when lying against a wall,
            or when hitting an object that blocks its top.
            <br><br>In order to detect collisions from different directions,
            four new variables are created to indicate collision states. In checkCollision() method, it no longer returns
            a boolean value that represents whether collision has happened. Instead, it changes the collision state variables,
            and returns corresponding information, that is the x or y value of the colliding surface, of any existing collision. 
            (See explanations in <strong><i>Position Re-adjustment</i></strong>)
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong style="font-size: large;"><i>Position Re-adjustment</i></strong>
            <br>
            After implementing a collision mechanism,
            one of the problems that pops up is a moving object might pass the hit box of the colliding object
            even after a collison is detected by the program. To solve this problem, re-adjusting the moving object
            to where the collision exactly happened is necessary. 
            <br><br>
            For example, in the image shown below, 
            the white block, representing a mob/player, is given the command to jump. The green block, representing a platform,
            should prevent the player from moving any further up after their hit boxs collide.
            But in this case, 1 game loop iteration before this, the player was not having any contact with the platform; because of
            its fast speed of jumping, the player block exceeds the boundary of the platform in the next game iteration.
        </p>
            <img src="/src/images/WhyReadjustPosition.png">
        <p>
            To implement the re-adjustments, checkCollision() method is changed that now it returns the information about the surface where
            a collison has happened, if there is a collosion happened. Those informations will be used as new coordinates for the object. In addition, when an object is moving towards one direction, a boolean variable will be
            set to True to make sure there will be a position re-adjustment in this direction once the object stops moving; and, this variable will 
            be reset to False after a re-adjustment is done. In practice, 4 such variables are needed on each direction to ensure that no object can
            glitch through a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this method is not perfect. In a worse case where the speed of a 
            object is incredibly high (more than 1x its own width or height) or the dimensions of 
            at least one colliding rectangle are too small, checkCollision() may
            not even be able to catch a colliding event. This disadvantage could be critical
            in the future for bullet flying. But maybe an alternative approch can be designed 
            for high speed and small size objects, like <strong>trajectory prediction</strong>.
